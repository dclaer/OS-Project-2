# CPU Scheduling Simulator

A Python implementation of various CPU scheduling algorithms with performance comparison.

## Features

- Implements 8 scheduling algorithms:
  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Priority Scheduling (both preemptive and non-preemptive)
  - Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)
  - Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)

- Calculates performance metrics:
  - Average Waiting Time (AWT)
  - Average Turnaround Time (ATT)
  - Average Response Time (ART)
  - CPU Utilization
  - Throughput
  - Algorithm Execution Time

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- No external dependencies required

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
